This project is to build a robotic arm that uses a yagi tube antenna to meausre different signal strengths at different antenna angles
The plan is to have the arm point the antenna at different angles in a 2D array fashion, and have the antenna take a reading of signal strength for a given SSID
This github repo will be used to write the code for the raspberry pi to be able to take readings of signal strengths and make the motors move in a 2D array
